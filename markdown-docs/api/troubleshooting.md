# Search API Troubleshooting

	- Remedy: Passwords with special characters need single quotes on Linux/Mac and double-quotes on Windows.  See search for examples.
- Trouble Area: Cookie request to /services/authentication/ fails with “410 Gone”
	- Reason: Cookie URL has been retired

	- Reason: Quotes look the same but are interpreted differently
	- Remedy: Where single quotes are present, delete and retype them in the terminal window.
- Trouble Area: API request with ‘+’ in it fails
	- Reason: Some keywords are stored in the database as two words with a space between them, some as two words joined with a ‘+’.
	- Remedy: Try your API request with a ‘+’. if that doesn’t work, replace the ‘+’ with ‘%2B’. One of them will work.

	- Reason: URLs at the command line may require the “&” to be escaped
	- Remedy: Replace ampersand “&” with backslash ampersand “\&” in the URL. OR use double quotes ” ” around the URL; URLs submitted via the browser use ampersand “&” without the backslash.

	- Reason: Keywords are case sensitive
	- Remedy: Ensure that your keywords are capitalized (or not) just as in the Keyword List.
