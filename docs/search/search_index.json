Baseline uses information from two synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the same target area acquired at different times (temporal baseline) and from slightly different satellite orbit positions (perpendicular baseline). The Vertex baseline tool helps you identify and select scene pairs that are appropriate for Interferometric SAR (InSAR) processing. It provides visualization of perpendicular and temporal baseline data, and allows you to easily change the reference scene used in any stack. How to use Vertex Baseline Tool Visit ASF's Vertex to begin using the SBAS tool. Beginning your Baseline Search If you do not have a particular reference scene chosen, you can search for scenes using the geographic or list search. The center column will have a button under the metadata titled Baseline Tool for any scenes that are eligible. You may click this button to be directed to a Baseline search. The Baseline search will use the chosen scene as the reference scene. If you do have a particular reference scene chosen, you can select Baseline from the Search Type dropdown list. You may enter your reference scene and hit Search . Interacting with Baseline Search Results While in Baseline Search type, you will notice many familiar controls in the results panel. The scenes are shown in the left column. The perpendicular and temporal baselines are listed next to each scene. The center column lists the metadata for the selected scene, and includes the Set as Reference button, which allows you to set any scene in the stack as the reference scene. The Baseline Chart is shown in the right column. Result Panel Controls At the top left of the results panel, you will see the number of scenes listed. Zoom will Zoom to results magnifying the map area of the Earth where the scenes are located. Queue will Add all results to Downloads allowing you to add all scenes to the download queue. On Demand will allow you to Add all results to On Demand queue to do custom processing on the scenes. To learn more click here . Export will allow you to Download data/metadata for all scenes in the stack. In the left column, Queue will Add scene files to downloads for the selected scene only. Under the metadata in the center column, Set as Reference will allow you to set any scene in the stack as the reference scene. When you select this, both the chart and the baseline values will be updated automatically. Chart Controls The dots on the chart represent individual scenes. Hovering over them will list their temporal and perpendicular values. You may also click on any point to select that scene. The metadata in the center column will be updated. Located above the chart, there are labels and corresponding colors. These indicate how the reference scene, selected scene, and any scenes in your download queue are displayed on the chart. Some datasets include a shaded area which indicates the critical baseline. You may zoom and pan the chart. You may click Baseline Criteria... above the chart for additional options. You can adjust the sliders to change the perpendicular and temporal values that you wish to be included in your results. You can enter a start and end date. Changing any criteria will automatically update the list of scenes and the chart. Next Steps Once you are satisfied with your result set, the next step is to create interferograms. There is custom processing available for creating interferograms through HyP3 . You may also use the download queue to manage and download baseline results.

Go to Vertex Log in by clicking the Sign in icon in the top right of the window. Use your Earthdata Login username and password. Search Type allows you to choose between Geographic , List , Baseline , SBAS , and On Demand Products search types. Geographic Search Options The Vertex map defaults to Satellite View Navigate to your area of interest by dragging the map while holding down the left mouse button. By default, the map-drawing tool is a bounding box. Click on the map once to specify the starting corner, move the mouse, then click again to finish the box. Additional drawing tool options are available in the toolbar at the top of the screen, including point , linestring , and polygon options. Point allows you to define an area of interest by clicking on the map to place a point. Line allows you to define an area of interest over a series of line segments by clicking on the map multiple times. Double-click to stop adding segments. Polygon allows you to define an area of interest over an arbitrary polygon. You will receive an error message at the bottom of the window if there was a problem with the polygon (self-intersecting, reversed polygon winding order, etc.). Box allows you to define an area of interest over a lat/long-aligned bounding box by clicking once to set one corner, and again to set the opposite corner. Once a shape has been drawn, select the Edit current area of interest icon on the toolbar to move, add, and delete points. Select the Draw new area of interest icon to create a new AOI. Dataset enables you to choose the dataset of interest. If you need more information about a particular dataset, click on the appropriate question mark icon in the Dataset selector. Area of Interest gives you the option of importing an area of interest as a geospatial file or by entering a set of geographic coordinates. Click on the down arrow next to Area of Interest in the top menu Click the Import Area of Interest button in the Options window Click Select Files and navigate to a folder on your computer, or drag and drop files into the box. GeoJSON , shapefiles , and KML files are supported provided they are in a latitude/longitude-based coordinate system, such as WGS84. When importing a GeoJSON file, all geometries in the file will be included. If multiple geometries are found, a convex hull will be used to represent them in the search. Shapefiles can be either a single .shp file, multiple shapefile components ( .shp, .shx, .dbf ), or a zip file containing one or more shapefile components. At a minimum, the .shp component must be included in all cases. An area of interest may also be defined by a set of coordinates entered in the Options window. Coordinates should be entered as decimal degrees in well-known text (WKT) format. Coordinates entered as a comma-separated long/lat string (e.g. -97.38,36.46,-53.44,36.46...) will be automatically converted by Vertex to WKT format. You can save the coordinates of a search so they can be used to exactly recreate an area of interest in later searches. Once the Area of Interest has been set, mouse over the coordinates. A Copy to clipboard icon will appear. Click on the icon and paste the coordinates into a new search or to a text file for later use. Note: See the section Other Vertex Options for additional ways of saving searches. At any time you can clear your search area by clicking on the Trash can icon in the top menu bar. Filters... enables you to further refine your search Date Filters Search dates are optional, so they default to empty. If you are searching for specific dates, you can define the date range further in the Start Date and End Date fields. The date picker will automatically constrain your selection to a valid range for the selected dataset. Note : this information may also be found by clicking on the question mark icon for a dataset. Seasonal Search allows constraining the search to certain annual periods within an overall range of dates. Click the Seasonal Search toggle and additional options will appear, allowing you to enter an overall date range ( Start Date/End Date ) and the seasonal range ( Season Start Day/Season End Day ). Additional Filters allow for additional parameters to be applied to narrow your search and reduce the number of results. Not all filters will be available for all datasets. File Type \u2013 Limit the search to specific types of files. Multiple selections allowed. Beam Mode \u2013 Limit the search to specific beam modes. Multiple selections allowed. Polarization \u2013 Limit the search to specific polarizations. Multiple selections allowed. Direction \u2013 Limit the search to a specific orbit direction. Subtype \u2013 Limit the search to a specific mission spacecraft. Path and Frame Filters are available for select datasets. You may enter a single path or frame, or a range. Due to inconsistent Sentinel-1 framing, we recommend searching for a frame of interest by \u00b11-2 frames. Once all parameters have been chosen, click SEARCH . Search results will appear in the footer area of the Vertex window, and on the map. Note : The number of files that are predicted to match the current search parameters is displayed under the SEARCH button.

By default, the map-drawing tool is a bounding box. Click on the map once to specify the starting corner, move the mouse, then click again to finish the box. Additional drawing tool options are available in the toolbar at the top of the screen, including point , linestring , and polygon options. Point allows you to define an area of interest by clicking on the map to place a point. Line allows you to define an area of interest over a series of line segments by clicking on the map multiple times. Double-click to stop adding segments. Polygon allows you to define an area of interest over an arbitrary polygon. You will receive an error message at the bottom of the window if there was a problem with the polygon (self-intersecting, reversed polygon winding order, etc.). Box allows you to define an area of interest over a lat/long-aligned bounding box by clicking once to set one corner, and again to set the opposite corner. Once a shape has been drawn, select the Edit current area of interest icon on the toolbar to move, add, and delete points. Select the Draw new area of interest icon to create a new AOI. Dataset enables you to choose the dataset of interest. If you need more information about a particular dataset, click on the appropriate question mark icon in the Dataset selector. Area of Interest gives you the option of importing an area of interest as a geospatial file or by entering a set of geographic coordinates. Click on the down arrow next to Area of Interest in the top menu Click the Import Area of Interest button in the Options window Click Select Files and navigate to a folder on your computer, or drag and drop files into the box. GeoJSON , shapefiles , and KML files are supported provided they are in a latitude/longitude-based coordinate system, such as WGS84. When importing a GeoJSON file, all geometries in the file will be included. If multiple geometries are found, a convex hull will be used to represent them in the search. Shapefiles can be either a single .shp file, multiple shapefile components ( .shp, .shx, .dbf ), or a zip file containing one or more shapefile components. At a minimum, the .shp component must be included in all cases. An area of interest may also be defined by a set of coordinates entered in the Options window. Coordinates should be entered as decimal degrees in well-known text (WKT) format. Coordinates entered as a comma-separated long/lat string (e.g. -97.38,36.46,-53.44,36.46...) will be automatically converted by Vertex to WKT format. You can save the coordinates of a search so they can be used to exactly recreate an area of interest in later searches. Once the Area of Interest has been set, mouse over the coordinates. A Copy to clipboard icon will appear. Click on the icon and paste the coordinates into a new search or to a text file for later use. Note: See the section Other Vertex Options for additional ways of saving searches. At any time you can clear your search area by clicking on the Trash can icon in the top menu bar. Filters... enables you to further refine your search Date Filters Search dates are optional, so they default to empty. If you are searching for specific dates, you can define the date range further in the Start Date and End Date fields.

SBAS is an acronym for short baseline subsets . It is a technique used in interferometry. The Vertex SBAS tool provides perpendicular and temporal baseline data, as well as scene pairs, for a chosen reference scene. What are some uses for SBAS? SBAS is widely used in the geosciences community. It works best for natural environments over a large scale and can be used to look at gradual change over time. SBAS requires input of a series of interferograms and the final output is a time series showing motion. One advantage of SBAS is that you are not restricted to a single interferogram. You can see gradual changes over time. It can also be useful for older datasets which sometimes have irregular acquisitions. The temporal and spatial filtering can help increase the accuracy for measuring deformation. You must choose which interferograms to use, which can require some experimentation. The Vertex SBAS tool simplifies this by providing good visualization and making it easier for you to quickly determine which scenes to use. There are other preferred approaches for urban environments, or higher resolution needs. However, regardless of your analysis needs, the SBAS tool is a useful overview tool and can also be used as a 2-D baseline plot. It gives a comprehensive, but rapid visualization of scenes. Further reading on baseline, including descriptions of multiple approaches, can be found here . A case study comparison of PS and SBAS can be found here . How to use Vertex SBAS Tool Visit ASF's Vertex to begin using the SBAS tool.
